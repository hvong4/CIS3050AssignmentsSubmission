Notes:
Get all the information and create the table/columns/rows for each data (both in sql and php).
Create a database to hold all the data.
Make sure the codes/scripts are correct.
Upload all the sql code first.
Implement the php code next (one by one, the long way - through file manager).
Get classmate's code and do the same (for both of their sql and php scripts/codes - I only got one classmate's code since 
I wasn't able to contact other people).
When I was trying to get the relationship of the tables to connect with each other in MS Access,
I wasn't able to do most of it (I only got one to connect). However, I did manage to assign primary key its appropriate field(s).
